## Evil Marharaja

_Created by Clay Crocker and his friends unknown._

**Evil Marharaja** is a social deduction game, similar in style to the commonly played Werewolf / Mafia.  However, Evil Marharaja aims to solve two key problems: (a) that the players who die early in Werewolf don't get to have any fun, (b) that the Werewolf game isn't that engaging with just a few people, and (c) that there must be a moderator character who doesn't get to play in the game.


#### Requirements

* 4-12 players

* Enough role cards to mark roles for those players.

* Enough separate spaces for there to be separate, private conversations in pairs that don't risk being overheard.


#### The Characters

To start the game, gather everyone in a group and distribute them secretly role cards (could be playing cards from a deck of playing cards) that signify the following characters.

* **The Evil Marharaja:** This person is the evil head honcho and they rules the town.  They get to call all the shots.  They win if they successfully identify one of the two Lovers during the Trial Round.

* **The Spy:** This person is the Evil Marharaja's ally; trying to find info about who the Lovers are and ratting on them to the Marharaja.  However, The Evil Marajaraha (for some reason) doesn't know who the Spy or Spies are, and thus can't truly trust anyone through the deception.  The Spy wins if the Evil Marharaja wins, that is if one of the two Lovers is successfully identified by the Evil Marharaja during the Trial Round.

* **The Lover:** These two people are in love.  They win if one of them successfully identifies the other during the Discovery Round.

* **The Friend:** The friend is a friend of The Lovers.  They don't know who the Lovers are, but they try to help the Lovers unite.  The Friend wins if the Lovers win, that is, if one of the two lovers identifies the other during the Discovery Round. 


#### Character Distribution

You can play with 4-12 players, dealing out characters in the following distributions:

* 4 players: 1 Marahraja, 2 Lovers, 1 Friend.  (This one is playable, but isn't that fun.)

* 5 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 1 Spy, 1 Friend.  (This one is playable -- and rather fun -- but is pretty hard for the Lovers.)

* 6 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 1 Spy, 2 Friends.  (This is the ideal game, in my opinion.)

* 7 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 1 Spy, 3 Friends.  (This one is playable and fun, but is pretty hard for the Marharaja.)

* 8 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 2 Spies, 3 Friends.  (Balanced again.)

* 9 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 2 Spies, 4 Friends.  (Now it's getting a big big and chaotic.)

* 10 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 2 Spies, 5 Friends.

* 11 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 3 Spies, 5 Friends.

* 12 players: 1 Marharaja, 2 Lovers, 3 Spies, 6 Friends.  (Any bigger than this and it's too chaotic for there to be enough fun.)


#### Turn System

The game is played in an unlimited number of turns, each of which contains three rounds:

* **The First Pairing Round:** All the players begin in the same room and cannot communicate.  The Evil Marharaja picks one player of their choice.  That player meets with the Evil Marharaja.  After that, every other player may pick another person to pair up with.  Every pair (including the pair with the Marharaja) goes into a separate room and has a private conversation.  This round goes for as little or as long as the Marharaja wishes, for a minimum of 4 minutes and a maximum of 15 minutes.  At the end of the round, everyone gathers back in the same room again but cannot communicate.

* **The Second Pairing Round:**  The same as The First Pairing Round, repeated again.

* **The Trial Round:** Everyone gathers in the same room and cannot communicate.  The Evil Marharaja chooses a person in the room they think is The Lover.  The chosen person then reveals their role.  If that person is a Lover, the game ends and the Evil Marharaja wins.  If that person is not a Lover, the game continues and that person dies (is removed from the game).

* **The Discovery Round:** Everyone staying in the same room and still being unable to communicate, the Evil Marharaja asks "Have the Lovers found each other yet?".  One of the Lovers may choose to say "Yes, I have found my other lover and that other lover is X" and name another player in the room.  The player named then reveals their role.  If the player named is indeed the other Lover, the Lovers win.  If the player named is not the other Lover, the Lovers lose and the Evil Marharaja wins.  It's also possible that no lover comes forward and no one answers the question.  If that is the case, the game continues with another turn, starting at The First Pairing Round.


#### What Can Happen in a Round

* It's important to note that all the communication between players should only happen (a) in pairs (b) within their separate room (c) during one of the two Pairing Rounds.  Any communication of information during transitions or during the Trial and Discovery Rounds is against the rules.

* While communication is taking place, a Lover may choose to reveal their role card to the other person in the pair, proving that they are indeed who they say they are (a Lover).  No other character is allowed to reveal their role card, except the Evil Marharaja.


#### Additional Rules

* If, during any of the pairing rounds, there are an odd number of alive players at the start, when the Marharaja picks a player to talk with, the Marharaja also picks a player to put in The Dungeon.  The player in The Dungeon stays in the same room as Tha Mararaja and the person talking with The Marajara and is allowed to hear the entire conversation, but the person in the dungeon may not speak during the conversation.

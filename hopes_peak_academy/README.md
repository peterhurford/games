## Hope's Peak Academy

**Hope's Peak Academy** is inspired by the anime [Danganronpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danganronpa).  It was created to improve upon Werewolf / Mafia by adding more viable information for players to go off of when figuring out who the Werewolves are.


#### Requirements

* X players.

* Enough role cards to mark roles (Werewolf or not) for those players.

* 4 books, or other objects.

* A large, preferably multi-floor, space to explore.


#### Prior Setup

* This game involves a significant amount of set-up before hand.

* The game must be moderated by a Moderator.

* Before the game begins, and unknown to the other players, the Moderator places four books hidden around the space.


#### The Characters

* **Humans:** These players are trying to survive.  They win by finding all the hidden books.  They win as soon as the fourth book is returned to the Council Room.

* **Werewolves:** These players are trying to kill all the humans.  They win as soon as the total number of living humans is equal to that of the total number of living werewolves.


#### Character Distribution

* Generally, Humans and Werewolves should be in a 4:1 ratio.  The more humans per werewolf, the easier it is for the humans to win.

* Obviously, there must be at least one werewolf (and at least one human).

* This makes the suggested minimum as 6 (1 moderator, 1 werewolf, 4 humans).

* There is no maximum, but once it gets above 15 it is pretty chaotic and hard to manage.  As the number of players grow, there may be need for additional moderators to referee the Exploration Round.


#### The Beginning

Everyone (humans and werewolves alike) begins in the same room, called the Council Room.  At the beginning of the game, everyone receives their role cards (secretly).  The Werewolves are then permitted to see their fellow Werewolves while the Humans don't see.  This is done by having all the players close their eyes and then have just the Werewolves open their eyes so they can see each other.  The Werewolves then close their eyes again and everyone opens their eyes and the game can begin.


#### Turn System

* The game is played in a number of turns that have no specified length.  Each turn has at least one round, the Exploration Round, and may have an additional round called the Judgement Round.

* After roles are established, players are permitted to leave the Council Room and explore the area around them, searching for Books.  This starts the Exploration Round.  When a book is found, it can be returned to the Council Room.  When all four books are returned to the Council Room, the humans win.  This means the game could be entirely complete in just the first Exploration Round, with no other rounds or turns.

* Books must be returned to the Council Room with two people (werewolves or humans) touching the Book at all times.  If this chain is broken, the Book is returned to where it was found.

* At any point during the turn, a werewolf may "attack" a human with a somewhat forceful two-handed touch (similar to touch football).  If a human is successfully attacked like this, the human must silently fall to the ground and play dead.  The turn continues until a separate, living human discovers the dead human.

* Once a living human discovers a dead human, a loud call must be made to end the round and bring everyone (humans and werewolves alike) to the Council Room.  Any Books in the process of being returned must be put on the ground wherever they were when the round ends.  Moderators should be dillegent to enforce an accurate and quick end to all turns, making sure all players are informed.

* Once in the Council Room, the Judgment Round begins.  All players have ten minutes to discuss amongst themselves who they think is a Werewolf, using whatever evidence they saw by observing behavior during the Exploration Round.  The players may then, by majority vote, vote to kill off one of the other players whom they think is a Werewolf.  After the votes are cast, the player killed has their role revealed and the players can see whether their kill was accurate.  The game then advances to the next turn and goes to another Exploration Round.

* If the ten minutes elapse and no vote has taken place, no players are killed and the game advances to the next turn and another Exploration Round.


#### Additional Rules

* If a werewolf has killed, but the dead human is not discovered and the turn keeps going on, the werewolf may continue to attempt to kill more players.  However, a werewolf must wait at least two full minutes between kills.

* In a circumstance where a werewolf is with multiple people in close-quarters at once, they can attempt a spree kill.  A spree kill must involve getting a two-handed touch on all attempted players with no more than five seconds between each kill.  This is to discourage players from clumping together to have "safety in numbers".  The Moderator should attempt, as much as is possible, to referee this.

* While a werewolf may kill someone carrying a Book, people carrying a Book may not be spree killed.

* All players are allowed to know how all other players voted in the Judgement Round.  The Moderator should see to this.
